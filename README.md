#Ticketing App
This repository contains a ticketing application that enables users to purchase tickets online and make payments. The application is built using React.js for the frontend, Node.js for the backend, and it follows a microservices architecture. MongoDB is used as the primary database for storage and JetStream (Pub/Sub system) as a communicator between microservices.

##Setup
Before running the application, ensure that you have set up the necessary configurations and dependencies.

###Secrets Configuration
To run the application, you need to create the following secrets using kubectl:
```
kubectl create secret generic jwt-secret --from-literal=JWT_KEY=your_jwt_secret
kubectl create secret generic stripe-secret --from-literal STRIPE_KEY=your_stripe_secret_key
Replace your_jwt_secret and your_stripe_secret_key with your preferred secret keys.
```

###Ingress Controller
To set up the Ingress controller for Kubernetes, apply the following configuration:

`kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx/controller-v1.8.2/deploy/static/provider/cloud/deploy.yaml`
This will deploy the Ingress controller, allowing external access to your application.

##Running the Application
After setting up the secrets and the Ingress controller, you can run the Ticketing App by following these steps:

1. Clone this repository:

`git clone https://github.com/your_username/ticketing-app.git`
Navigate to the project directory:

`cd ticketing-app`
2. Install dependencies for each service:

```
cd auth && npm install && cd ..
cd tickets && npm install && cd ..
cd orders && npm install && cd ..
